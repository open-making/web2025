It was fascinating to see those     \n  old websites—watching them was both fun and creatively inspiring.\n-We all signed up for GitHub in class. At first, I found it a bit boring, but once I started exploring, it turned out to be pretty \n  interesting.\n-I also learned new things like how to comment properly on GitHub and other useful features.\n-Right now, I’ve completed my assignment, and it was such a fun experience. It felt so creative going through different websites \n  and seeing the amazing things people have built online.\n-The most important thing I learned was observing the evolution of websites from 1996 to 2024. It’s truly unimaginable how\n  much web design and development have improved over time.\n\n## Class Assignment \nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAGt0UF84D0/THzs-obMyxcxJHJ32_hYxg/view?utm_content=DAGt0UF84D0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h021f6dcaca\n\n<img width=\"719\" height=\"757\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e919bdb9-9af6-4a46-a4a2-64d7c0f9b212\" />",
