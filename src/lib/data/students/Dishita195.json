I love how it doesn't feel like a class but like I am exploring one of my interests to just learn something fun. We got to see how people used internet for showcasing their creativity and their life before standardized layouts made life boring. All personal websites felt like real people with raw feelings talking to you trusting you'll understand. I could have never imagined working with web design would look like this. We are being encouraged to look at things from a different perspective breaking what limits the industry has tried to set on our imaginations and I am extremely happy to have had this chance!\n\n**Figma link:** https://www.figma.com/design/RCBucDezq7RWYFEDgqfqC2/Web-Design-Assignment-1?node-id=0-1&t=vwiiLfidPNGGuclm-1\n\n<img width=\"1120\" height=\"559\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2c786c1-1f96-4a11-9c94-d5ee35fc00e1\" />",

      "content": "# Day 07 - Planning My Digital Garden\n\nToday we talked about indie web and making our own digital garden. I looked through websites for inspiration and understanding how my own personal garden can be planted, grown and maintained! Then I brainstormed things, feelings and ideas that intrigue me, define me and guide me, on a large piece of paper. \n\nHere's a little quote that I really liked from today's class.\n\n<img width=\"597\" height=\"435\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/505169a2-2f69-48a9-b9fc-987c59948fb5\" />\n\n####  My Brainstorming:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2698192a-8233-4ba8-afdb-a56dd17b8d53)\n\n\n##  Manifesto\n\nIt is a place I want to use for sharing a part of me that seems unfiltered. I want it to feel like me. A place I use to safekeep and showcase everything I make I love and I admire. I've decided to keep several distractions or 'treasure hunts' for my visitors spread all across my website randomly because I want my space to be a little chaotic and messy, and going in all directions just like letting your mind wander. I want my visitors to wander, explore and be surprised. \n\nA section would comprise of my artworks of all kinds. I haven't decided yet if and how I want to segregate them. But basic layout will be title-image-description. \n\nAnother section will have a photo gallery of all the insect photos I've filled my gallery with (and some other little things I occasionally find in nature) and will be updated every time I set out to wander. A subsection of it might include some stories that went unheard for people who might be interested in what happened with an ant, a spider, a twig or a caterpillar. So a grid for the photo gallery and  a simple layout of title-date-content for the stories maybe? haven't decided yet.\n\nOne section will have a small part of jainism, (two spotify links and some text)  that has shaped my life, something I adore and respect.\n\nI have a few more things in mind like an animated movies I've watched section, and cards to collect while wandering etc. I am working on the final layouts. \n\n## Bonus Question\n\n\"I believe the best way to learn web design is to actually build something we care about\". Well now we're building one and letting our imaginations go wild. I cannot stress this enough that I am so surprised that I haven't started to hate coding yet. I think it helps me professionally because now I am way more confident about making websites than I was just a week ago be it for any purpose. It does have a larger point beyond this class, beyond just a module, its personal, its empowering and it sets us apart from the mundane monotonous minimalist life. \n\n\n\n \n",
