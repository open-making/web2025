How do we perceive the web?\nGet to know a lot of new things.\nWhile surfing the internet and looking at different websites, I realized how everything now is generic and does not have a personal touch. We really went from cool self-expressive websites to professional website with boxes and no personal touch. It is totally sad.\nI found the class very interesting and fun, i never thought i would look into so many website in one day but it was worth it looking at someone’s cat, gallery, comics, art, music, personal dedications, or just a site with a “under construction” or “be patient i am working on it” notes. I hope to enjoy rest of the classes in the same way!\nI had this thing constantly in my mind that so many creative people are out there just doing amazing work. I keep thinking, how did they make it?

Like the thought behind it, to make us explore more and more without the pressure of making something look good.\nThe game was the most interesting part, initially i thought i won’t be able to clear the level but when i started i was having fun and completed all the level.

It also encourages me to try more things later on.\nI liked the discussion we had in class today about Jen Simmons' video and related topics, especially who we want to code for. The discussion keeps the class lively and opens up a lot of new perspectives.\nStarted the second grid layout, will complete it soon!

(if that makes sense.)\nAs a person who has n number of interests, I keep jumping from one to another every time. I want the website to show the parts of me which I keep forgetting, which I have, and I can always go back to them when I am lost. For example, there are so many quotes from different places that I want people to read at least once, which are cool, and people with similar interests can find them and enjoy. I just want to put my thoughts out there. \nThis space is my personal for yapping about the things which I find interesting and cool. I have a lot of things which I want to talk about, so maybe I can put all those in there and leave it for the like-minded people.\nI want it to be easy to navigate and simply pleasing to the eyes. Minimal basic colours, simple aesthetic. (just this for now)\nObviously, I want my professional work to be there also because it's one of the biggest parts of my life for which I constantly keep working, and I want more people to know about that. \nI want this website to be a reflection of what Monika Singh is. Kind of like my professional and personal journal.\n\nThe basic structure of what I am thinking of is \nImage, title, Short description (it can be fro mt art pieces)\nMaybe list for recommendation (I have to think more on that)\nI was also thinking of a random gallery of photographs I took(just randomly put it out kind of)\nI still have to think more(will be done by tomorrow)\n\n# Bonus\nIs there a larger point beyond this class? Do you see this helping you professionally? The answer is yes for me. I think it is going to help me beyond this class. For as long as I can remember a lot of designers or working professionals I have met they always told me to have a portfolio website(maybe it adds points?) and hearing that, I always wanted to make one or get it made. But now I am happy that I get to know how to make one. I know it's too early to dream of something big, but I am going to anyway. (i will learn more and more and keep upgrading my skills)\nThis module has given me the opportunity to learn it and explore more, and I am going to take advantage to the fullest.\n",
