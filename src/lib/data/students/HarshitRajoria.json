It was positive day where I learned about the tearm Indie Web, something that feels like ours. Got to know its principles. Went through many blogs and different websites that can help buiding my websites.\n\n<img width=\"1034\" height=\"886\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e430404-21ec-49f3-ae3a-4d959e3e824f\" />\n\n### My Manifesto\n\nThis website is about deep diving into my experiences where you will look at all of my work connected with my interests. Even building this website from scratch will itself be a part of my portfolio. This website is totally made by me without depending on any constraints where I have to follow somebody else’s guideline or layout. I believe in Independent Ownership where I as a designer can showcase my progress and share personal knowledge. It is a safe platform where you will flow freely. If you’ll give time in the exploration, it may assist you with many resources and insights.\nI will be updating my website in every 6 months and I always try to make it feel like a friend sharing his experiences to another friend.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fe1bb6-414c-4402-b623-f9e3ca0bf3fc)\n",
