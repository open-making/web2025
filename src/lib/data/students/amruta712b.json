The Internet is such a vast and endless space; there's so much cool stuff out there of which we have no idea. \n- the push to search and explore archived websites, new-age websites, websites that look simple but are much cooler to the tech-savvy websites wouldn't have happened otherwise if not for the assignment\n- People have been creating uniquely crafted websites even before there was a need or competitive urge to do so. Why? How? probably out of sheer care for what they do.\n-while web surfing, whenever I came across an interesting interaction or feature or a gesture, it intrigued me how it would have happened, what it is called, and how I can do it. But usually this burst of enthusiasm or sudden urge to transform myself 180 degrees is ephemeral and dies soon. So I need to figure out a way to keep the curiosity ignited throughout the module to make the best of it!\n- The reading \" My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be?\"  explains the world of the internet to a technologically challenged person like me about the web and the internet in a very \"easy-to-understand\" manner.

Although still a long way to go with figuring out the rest of the relevant tags and logic of div and class to achieve what I want, the process has been so far enjoyable and not overwhelming.  This type of individual project-based learning, which is also collaborative in a sense, has felt so much more productive. TBH, before the module began, my assumptions were that my inhibitions for making a website would grow stronger, just with the sound of HTML and CSS in the class description.

      "content": "# Day 6 - Making grids\n**What worked**\n-Firstly, the constant reassurance that it may seem hard now, but we will be able to figure out and get the hang of it \n-the practice of \"coding along\" whenever we learn something new\n-the game which helped bring clarity to the logic of the codes\n-the assignment through i am trying to stay a(float) :P ( the pun was intented)\n\n**What didn't work/ or seems not to work for now**\n-ig its in my head, maybe, but \"coding along\" sessions as much as they are necessary, sometimes they also feel like a life jacket. What I mean by life jacket is, as soon as we are asked to do something of our own or to do something like today's exercise,  I feel like that life jacket has been taken away, and now how am I going to get through this? Not that I am stressing about it, but before beginning any HTML file, initially, it feels overwhelming.\n-the initial youtube video that we had seen which had explained the idea of body, parapgraph and other tags had helped me visualise, it would be great if there were more tangible examples to explain section, div, main and article which we have learned recently, because i like to imagine these entities and assoicate them with real life objects to understand them better.\n-also, \"github\" \"server\" seems like words that are difficult to imagine what it would look like. For eg, the interface or the idea of Facebook and Instagram does not seem really difficult to understand because maybe I am able to relate them to real-life scenarios. When I had downloaded Discord, I was feeling so frazzled with the idea of servers, rooms, and channels. I still find it difficult to navigate, but slowly i dont feel taken aback with the interface. So similarly, for me github's interface seems slightly overwhelming.\n\n**Grid**\nPersonally, from Jen Simmon's video, I loved how she thought we could take inspiration from the De Stijl art movement into a grid. I am looking forward to trying unconventional layouts in grids, which, for once are designed for me and not an imaginary user. ",

      "content": "# notes of the day\n-owning a website helps you not be at the mercy of other providers\n- My work first needs to make sense to me\n- Today's presentation and the websites that I have come across so far during this module have been an eye-opener. Tbh, I never knew websites like the ones I saw on Geocities or WebArchives could exist. For me, the definition of web design up until I saw these cool sites was the \"conventional website,\" which we commonly see. \n- The metaphor of a garden, to explain that websites can be there to track your growth, progress, and overall life documentation, has been helpful to explore today\n\n# Manifesto\n\nAs an introvert, I think I rely on art and other faceless mediums to express myself, and I think a website could be one of them. I want spaces to have multiple little windows into my life, revealing just enough to be curious. Till now, I have explored multiple mediums of art, different areas of design, and struggles of switching career fields ( from architecture to visual design), had my \"owning my curly hair \" journey, struggled with food allergies in a country like India, where the idea of food allergies is very alien, and found my ways to naviagte through a world overcrowded with extroverts. Thus, with this website, I would want to talk about topics I wish I had known before, along with the work that I have done revolving around the subjects of my interest. \n\n As I am writing this manifesto at this very moment, I can visualise different layouts and ideas: a quiet corner, a rant space,  space for an introvert, my allergy treatment journey, and a whole lot of paw prints ( just like digital footprints) for the good bois-doggos we don't appreciate enough\n\n# bonus question \n\nI feel it is somewhat beneficial to have your platform to express yourself on the web, but I am not aware of how much it helps in acquiring work, such as jobs, commissions, or freelance projects. Perhaps I am still a novice in understanding the benefits, but if I invest my time and effort in creating something, I would naturally desire to reap the benefits and fruits of my labor. Because I may create a website now with a sudden urge of enthusiasm, but without any viewers, I doubt how motivated I will be later to maintain or update it. Although keeping aside the constraints of coding, the idea of creating a web space that is unconventional sounds cool as an approach; to be able to achieve something from the reference website would be a huge confidence booster. As far as the \"Is there a larger point beyond this class? Do you see this helping you professionally? \" question is concerned, I would say yes! Definitely, this class has opened new learning portals for me. Not sure atm how I'm going to incorporate it in my style or practice, but there's room for it definitely, because it has made me curious to learn/explore further\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/206d1a2f-07b1-4f94-bf61-27b0133f5585)",

My idea was to make a fun website, and I hadn't expected the process to become enjoyable or fun as well. For now, I am thinking of writing code for the basic layouts and then getting into the \"nit-picking\" phase for the details, because I feel I am getting carried away in accomplishing the details, and then end up with no substantial progress.\n\n# Question\nDoes the footer door size look apt or should i increase it?\n\n\nNetlify: https://amruta-portfolio-website.netlify.app/\nRepo:  https://github.com/amruta712b/amruta-portfolio-website\n\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1964\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6cf564-6c3c-4597-925f-de1aba9667b8\" />\n\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1964\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f54df6b5-d6dc-4d0c-9485-f86670f48091\" />\n\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1964\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c50c1c58-e427-4b10-9c01-757151f47cb8\" />",
