It also watered my hope of being able to do design in this era of AI, **The idea and belief that websites can be built considering that these are made for humans, not a robot that is there just to get information,  Just like how talking to a person isn't only about getting facts, but also about experiencing their personality, websites can be the same. They can feel alive, expressive, and full of character.**\n\nThe idea of comparing websites to a person who is communicating with us, was introduced to me by a book by everett N. McKayI some years ago and i always used to think that websites can also be more visually appealing, have more personality, and be expressive. And today, I got introduced to this small web era, and I could not stop browsing more and more websites. Neocities really blew my mind, some of the websites there were very creative and mind-blowing. And using the Wayback Machine was also very fun it kind of felt like using a time machine.\n\nClass Assignment:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/k1o1fyoyAyg34pRNz9xt2k/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=MYHLaNW6VNkvUMlK-1\n\n\n<img width=\"633\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/335c4a5f-8668-4125-87c8-9be80d495a05\" />\n",

I think I am being very choosy about it. First, I was thinking of something very flashy and ornamental, but then I wasn't confident about that and thought it might irritate the visitor. Then I considered something simpler or something that isn’t very graphic, but again, that didn’t feel right. So I’m feeling stuck. I’ll try again tomorrow for layout ideas that don’t overwhelm the visitor but are still visually appealing and unique at some level.
