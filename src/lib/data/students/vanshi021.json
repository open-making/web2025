      "content": "### **Immersive Web Design - Assignment 1**\n\n#### **1. Class Learning’s:**\n\nThe first question we were asked was what do we imagine a website looks like…\n**Website as a Tree**\nI’ve come to see a website much like a tree. The homepage acts as the trunk — the central structure, the face of it all. From there, links and buttons branch out like limbs and leaves, guiding visitors to different areas and experiences. Just as a tree needs daily care and nurturing to grow from a sapling into something strong and full of life, a website too requires consistent attention, updates, and creativity to thrive. This metaphor helps me connect with the process more personally and organically.\n\n**Class Notes – Day 1 Reflection**\nThe first class gave me a new sense of confidence — helping me view the web and websites not as intimidating networks of code, but as creative, personal spaces. Coming from a commerce background and now venturing into design, the idea of working with code felt daunting at first. But the way the class unfolded made it approachable, step by step, one day at a time.\n\nWhat surprised me most was discovering that the internet can be a platform for self-expression. Until now, I always saw websites as formal, impersonal entities. That perspective shifted entirely. Now, I see them as living canvases — spaces that can reflect individuality, creativity, and personal voice.\n\nThis was truly a “learning by unlearning” experience — letting go of preconceived notions and opening up to new ways of seeing and creating. It was exciting, and I’m looking forward to what comes next.\n\n#### **2.

I always appreciate learning through doing. Reading helps a lot but when we actually sit to do things ourselves it gives an opportunity to try new things, these trials might fail but every trail is a lesson in itself. The part of the class where we styled a web page along with the professor gave a different kind of excitement towards coding and actually seeing results on the screen. Looking forward to more such activities. \n\nBasic Design Layout:\nThe following is a basic step by step process i have done to get a layout for the story web page:\n1. The first rough idea-\n \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68690828-beb1-438a-84f6-cb001fe87c63)\n\n2.

But before the words or the content could speak i want the layout to speak to the audience. I am aiming to make this for others to see me as a person, maybe enjoy and join my interest areas, get some ideas for themselves or maybe to know what they should not be. The website will have two sides of me which will be first completely personal and second which is my professional side.\nThings this website might include:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7108128d-b2cc-4f34-9705-60eafb211262)\nBonus:\nI am making this with an aim to represent myself with a whole new setup and doing this through something which I created (the website).
