I faced a few problems like figuring out how span works. which was confusing in the beginning, but I managed to figure it out. As I keep doing the confusion started to reduce, although some doubts still remain. I’m working on clearing them step by step. I’m learning new things and enjoying the process. At one point, my mind felt a bit stuck and tired, but I’m determined to keep trying and moving forward.\nAnd today’s game really helped a lot it was not just helpful, but also the kind of fun experienced. Playing and learning this way was truly refreshing.\n\n<img width=\"1416\" height=\"667\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92f25678-e884-4283-b842-75ad825b7cb5\" />\nIt's look easy, but doing it really fried my brain.\n\n<img width=\"1191\" height=\"615\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02553293-fcd5-4f7b-92d7-ab7cf77ed424\" />",
