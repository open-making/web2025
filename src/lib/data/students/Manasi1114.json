We don't leave things up for interpretation in this day and age. We write, put our stuff out and let the audience in on our thought processes behind the scenes of the work. We make.\n\n### We put our stuff out.\n\nThis revelation came after all the web surfing we have done during this small activity. It was one of the most striking things to notice. The sheer number of unfinished/ under construction websites! The authors had a lot to say (and show) and they put in the time and effort to start and basically kept addendum-ing the whole thing. Quite different from the \"locked-in\" LinkedIn bro sentimentality.\n\nConcluding this wonderful (to me) soliloquy, I would like to re-iterate that I'm almost as excited and hopeful for next few weeks as my colleagues!\n\n> **_A website is an individual act of collective ambition._**  \n          --Laurel Schwulst\n\nHere's the moodboard of the activity.

      "content": "### Week 2- Reflections on an indie website\n\nRight out of the gate, I want to say how much I appreciate this class (instructor+suggested readings) for getting preconceived notions of a website out of my mind. That it must be this way and that, professional (which really means generic) forever chasing noble dreams of a universal design. While it may or may not work out for huge conglomerates, it seems to be an exercise in futility for lil old me. The class have reading engineers and designers talk on and on about having a little space on the web that's entirely yours and never have I ever read people discuss websites (of all things) so _earnestly._ Website as a garden metaphor has been a game changer in visualizing and _thinking_ about the \"content\" better. \n\nThese are the articles that I read today:\n\n-[My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/)\n\n[How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)\n\n[Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)\n\n[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)\n\n[Principles of Indie web](https://indieweb.org/principles)\n\n[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)\n\n[As we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)\n\n[Where good ideas come from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0af00UcTO-c)\n\n[Mike Caulfield's keynote address- digital garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY)\n\n\n**Content structure and layout**\nAt the moment, my mind is working itself in listicles and bi-directional links, like a personal web diary. A basic UI for blogging and updating stuff would do for now (stuff means multimedia). I am thinking about how to lay the content out on each page atm. \n\nOne thing I'd want to steal from the Maggie Appleton blog is the transition of of her table of contents.\n\nThis is where the brainstorming led me today:\n\n<img width=\"1127\" height=\"804\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60362869-10f6-46bd-ab03-d344f5105376\" />\n\n**My thoughts on why any of this matters**\nMike Caulfield mentions in his blog about the prevalence of streaming over a digital garden over the last 20 years.\n_\"Streams only surface the zeitgiesty idea of the last 24 hours... even that is algorithmically filtered.\"_ \nOften have I lamented not saving an ig post or losing a good tweet before bookmarking it, the sheer amount of fast informations that the humans are creating in this moment in time. Where does it live, after I press Like or Swipe left on it? Does the owner have the right of controlling and, dare I say, boosting his/her reach on their own? Also, today's virtual landscape doesn't allow for imperfections and under construction works to exist easily. Or any genuine experimentation for that matter. \n\nThe manifesto is cooking itself at the moment. I went to watch the new Fantastic Four movie with H and R from the class. It was awesome, if we ignore the CGI baby lol\n\nfin",

      "content": "### Breaking out my inner Freddie Mercury\n\nThe biggest blockers I had yesterday was figuring out the syntax of the new framework, and finalizing on a sitemap. I have shelved a few things for later, like linking a sitemap in Astro and major styling but determining how the structure of the folder was the win for today. \n\nToday's goals and stuff finished:\n- [x] Barebones structure of the home page\n- [x] DirectoryLayout.astro\n- [x] Linking all the creation pages\n- [ ] Set up Sitemaps\n\nTomorrow: \n- [ ] Write md files for each category\n- [ ] Make LibraryLayout.astro for magazine and bookhouse index pages\n- [ ] Make layout for quotes and poetry pages\n- [ ] Give finishing touches to components\n\nMost of tomorrow would be spent out, but I am happy for today's progress. Will work later in the evening after getting home!\nExcited.\n\nRepo link: https://github.com/Manasi1114/dainty-words-manasi\nNetlify link: https://daintyduck.netlify.app/",
