At first, all those rows and columns felt confusing, but once we started playing around, it just clicked. It was like solving puzzles with code. Honestly, learning this way made layout design feel way less scary and way more exciting!**\n\n**Today’s chat about Jen Simmons and who we’re designing for really got me thinking it felt meaningful, not just about the visuals.\nCSS Grid was way more fun than I expected. It’s not just boxes it’s creative! I loved how it connects to our typography stuff too.\nBuilding things slowly from scratch made it feel doable.**",

Same with historical places. I’ve always been curious about stories from the past, and putting them here feels like a way to collect the ones that moved me.\nThen there's music and dramas they’ve honestly been my comfort space. Songs I replay when I’m low, shows that felt like friends. I want to share them like little pieces of what shaped me. And of course, an “About Me” page, just to say hey, this is who I am no big explanation, just vibes.\nI noticed some blogs are super minimal and chill, and I liked that. Not everything needs to be loud. I might borrow that soft, personal vibe.\nIn the end, maybe this doesn’t matter to the world, but it matters to me. It's a space that’s mine, and that feels like a good enough reason.\n\n**",

After planning and imagining it for so long, seeing it slowly come to life on the screen is such a cool feeling. I'm figuring things out as I go—experimenting with layouts, colors, fonts, and little hover effects that make it feel more me. There are definitely moments where I get stuck or frustrated, but I’m learning a lot in the process. It’s like building a digital version of myself, one line of code at a time.\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/907e6450-fb9d-4cb9-9682-b4bf65b2b6cf\" />\n\n**",
