It‚Äôs imperfect, maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. - This made me feel less bad for my unfinished portfolio website.\n- Metaphors are powerful for understanding and explaining something.\n\nTo sum up today‚Äôs class, it definitely gave me a unique perspective towards websites and somewhere made me rethink my relationship with coding.\n\n \n\n[Class Assignment | Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/AuA4d8gcFeyKxwFK90mZrb/Web-Assignment-01?node-id=1-8&t=TVNyKHNyxdF3T74m-1)\n\n[WWW-MeetBaxi.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21352727/WWW-MeetBaxi.pdf)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/896d9d58-bd8c-44e2-b4ad-ed40298ade9b)\n\n\n\n",
