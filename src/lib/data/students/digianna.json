Since i am a person who likes jumping and exploring a bunch I just.could.not.pick.one.damn.niche. And then I finally got it, i gotta zoom out. What are the general things i like and the GENERAL things that stay constant in my life - my first answer was the colour purple before i remembered that colours make me feel things pretty deeply and influence my thoughts and what if i stopped liking purple?? plus i would stay stuck choosing colours foreverrrrrrrrrrr. so back to the drawing board , how can it be made simpler- we keep it black and white for now and have three lists for my website-\n1. Gratitude list- whre i write something i am thankful for every day\n2.  learnings-  i am a person that has many many AHA moments, but i often forget them lol so here's where i note those down. A TIL list plus old learnings as i remember them ig.\n3. One thing i like about myself or something i did. \n\nWorking on my website making skills with w3school and looking at other people's websites plus inspecting , struggling to find nice websites that dont use javascript.\n",
