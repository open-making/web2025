How do we perceive the web?\nGet to know a lot of new things.\nWhile surfing the internet and looking at different websites, I realized how everything now is generic and does not have a personal touch. We really went from cool self-expressive websites to professional website with boxes and no personal touch. It is totally sad.\nI found the class very interesting and fun, i never thought i would look into so many website in one day but it was worth it looking at someone’s cat, gallery, comics, art, music, personal dedications, or just a site with a “under construction” or “be patient i am working on it” notes. I hope to enjoy rest of the classes in the same way!\nI had this thing constantly in my mind that so many creative people are out there just doing amazing work. I keep thinking, how did they make it?

It also encourages me to try more things later on.\nI liked the discussion we had in class today about Jen Simmons' video and related topics, especially who we want to code for. The discussion keeps the class lively and opens up a lot of new perspectives.\nStarted the second grid layout, will complete it soon!

(if that makes sense.)\nAs a person who has n number of interests, I keep jumping from one to another every time. I want the website to show the parts of me which I keep forgetting, which I have, and I can always go back to them when I am lost. For example, there are so many quotes from different places that I want people to read at least once, which are cool, and people with similar interests can find them and enjoy. I just want to put my thoughts out there. \nThis space is my personal for yapping about the things which I find interesting and cool. I have a lot of things which I want to talk about, so maybe I can put all those in there and leave it for the like-minded people.\nI want it to be easy to navigate and simply pleasing to the eyes. Minimal basic colours, simple aesthetic. (just this for now)\nObviously, I want my professional work to be there also because it's one of the biggest parts of my life for which I constantly keep working, and I want more people to know about that. \nI want this website to be a reflection of what Monika Singh is. Kind of like my professional and personal journal.\n\nThe basic structure of what I am thinking of is \nImage, title, Short description (it can be fro mt art pieces)\nMaybe list for recommendation (I have to think more on that)\nI was also thinking of a random gallery of photographs I took(just randomly put it out kind of)\nI still have to think more(will be done by tomorrow)\n\n# Bonus\nIs there a larger point beyond this class? Do you see this helping you professionally? The answer is yes for me. I think it is going to help me beyond this class. For as long as I can remember a lot of designers or working professionals I have met they always told me to have a portfolio website(maybe it adds points?) and hearing that, I always wanted to make one or get it made. But now I am happy that I get to know how to make one. I know it's too early to dream of something big, but I am going to anyway. (i will learn more and more and keep upgrading my skills)\nThis module has given me the opportunity to learn it and explore more, and I am going to take advantage to the fullest.\n",

And I was very close to go back to vanilla HTML but eventually I figured it out a little and am working on it with Astro. I will eventually figure it out little by little and keep working.\nOverall, I was happy, at least I was able to code the home page and I am working on the css of it. I still have to work on illustration, that’s why I am working with sample images for now.\nAgain, overall still excited to make the website.\n\nRepository link\nhttps://github.com/Monika7singh/web2025-monika-site/tree/master/src\n\nNetlify link\nhttps://monika-singh-space.netlify.app/\n\n<img width=\"1916\" height=\"841\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a30ed97-3709-4704-b56b-2b57d7f91695\" />\n",

We don't leave things up for interpretation in this day and age. We write, put our stuff out and let the audience in on our thought processes behind the scenes of the work. We make.\n\n### We put our stuff out.\n\nThis revelation came after all the web surfing we have done during this small activity. It was one of the most striking things to notice. The sheer number of unfinished/ under construction websites! The authors had a lot to say (and show) and they put in the time and effort to start and basically kept addendum-ing the whole thing. Quite different from the \"locked-in\" LinkedIn bro sentimentality.\n\nConcluding this wonderful (to me) soliloquy, I would like to re-iterate that I'm almost as excited and hopeful for next few weeks as my colleagues!\n\n> **_A website is an individual act of collective ambition._**  \n          --Laurel Schwulst\n\nHere's the moodboard of the activity. I've never had to do anything for a class that I did in my free time anyway lol. \nAll the websites urls are linked in figma, if anyone wants to go visit some of them really wonderful pieces of work!\n\n[Moodboard](https://www.figma.com/design/eM5A5FYHvlvVHwcfec7BJj/Web-surfing-moodboard?node-id=27-125&t=0gyh29WBJwvROzAJ-1)\n\n**_Visit the biggest link first.

          "content": "### Week 2- Reflections on an indie website\n\nRight out of the gate, I want to say how much I appreciate this class (instructor+suggested readings) for getting preconceived notions of a website out of my mind. That it must be this way and that, professional (which really means generic) forever chasing noble dreams of a universal design. While it may or may not work out for huge conglomerates, it seems to be an exercise in futility for lil old me. The class have reading engineers and designers talk on and on about having a little space on the web that's entirely yours and never have I ever read people discuss websites (of all things) so _earnestly._ Website as a garden metaphor has been a game changer in visualizing and _thinking_ about the \"content\" better. \n\nThese are the articles that I read today:\n\n-[My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/)\n\n[How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)\n\n[Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)\n\n[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)\n\n[Principles of Indie web](https://indieweb.org/principles)\n\n[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)\n\n[As we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)\n\n[Where good ideas come from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0af00UcTO-c)\n\n[Mike Caulfield's keynote address- digital garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY)\n\n\n**Content structure and layout**\nAt the moment, my mind is working itself in listicles and bi-directional links, like a personal web diary. A basic UI for blogging and updating stuff would do for now (stuff means multimedia). I am thinking about how to lay the content out on each page atm. \n\nOne thing I'd want to steal from the Maggie Appleton blog is the transition of of her table of contents.\n\nThis is where the brainstorming led me today:\n\n<img width=\"1127\" height=\"804\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60362869-10f6-46bd-ab03-d344f5105376\" />\n\n**My thoughts on why any of this matters**\nMike Caulfield mentions in his blog about the prevalence of streaming over a digital garden over the last 20 years.\n_\"Streams only surface the zeitgiesty idea of the last 24 hours... even that is algorithmically filtered.\"_ \nOften have I lamented not saving an ig post or losing a good tweet before bookmarking it, the sheer amount of fast informations that the humans are creating in this moment in time. Where does it live, after I press Like or Swipe left on it? Does the owner have the right of controlling and, dare I say, boosting his/her reach on their own? Also, today's virtual landscape doesn't allow for imperfections and under construction works to exist easily. Or any genuine experimentation for that matter. \n\nThe manifesto is cooking itself at the moment. I went to watch the new Fantastic Four movie with H and R from the class. It was awesome, if we ignore the CGI baby lol\n\nfin",

I love how it doesn't feel like a class but like I am exploring one of my interests to just learn something fun. We got to see how people used internet for showcasing their creativity and their life before standardized layouts made life boring. All personal websites felt like real people with raw feelings talking to you trusting you'll understand. I could have never imagined working with web design would look like this. We are being encouraged to look at things from a different perspective breaking what limits the industry has tried to set on our imaginations and I am extremely happy to have had this chance!\n\n**Figma link:** https://www.figma.com/design/RCBucDezq7RWYFEDgqfqC2/Web-Design-Assignment-1?node-id=0-1&t=vwiiLfidPNGGuclm-1\n\n<img width=\"1120\" height=\"559\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2c786c1-1f96-4a11-9c94-d5ee35fc00e1\" />",

          "content": "# Day 07 - Planning My Digital Garden\n\nToday we talked about indie web and making our own digital garden. I looked through websites for inspiration and understanding how my own personal garden can be planted, grown and maintained! Then I brainstormed things, feelings and ideas that intrigue me, define me and guide me, on a large piece of paper. \n\nHere's a little quote that I really liked from today's class.\n\n<img width=\"597\" height=\"435\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/505169a2-2f69-48a9-b9fc-987c59948fb5\" />\n\n####  My Brainstorming:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2698192a-8233-4ba8-afdb-a56dd17b8d53)\n\n\n##  Manifesto\n\nIt is a place I want to use for sharing a part of me that seems unfiltered. I want it to feel like me. A place I use to safekeep and showcase everything I make I love and I admire. I've decided to keep several distractions or 'treasure hunts' for my visitors spread all across my website randomly because I want my space to be a little chaotic and messy, and going in all directions just like letting your mind wander. I want my visitors to wander, explore and be surprised. \n\nA section would comprise of my artworks of all kinds. I haven't decided yet if and how I want to segregate them. But basic layout will be title-image-description. \n\nAnother section will have a photo gallery of all the insect photos I've filled my gallery with (and some other little things I occasionally find in nature) and will be updated every time I set out to wander. A subsection of it might include some stories that went unheard for people who might be interested in what happened with an ant, a spider, a twig or a caterpillar. So a grid for the photo gallery and  a simple layout of title-date-content for the stories maybe? haven't decided yet.\n\nOne section will have a small part of jainism, (two spotify links and some text)  that has shaped my life, something I adore and respect.\n\nI have a few more things in mind like an animated movies I've watched section, and cards to collect while wandering etc. I am working on the final layouts. \n\n## Bonus Question\n\n\"I believe the best way to learn web design is to actually build something we care about\". Well now we're building one and letting our imaginations go wild. I cannot stress this enough that I am so surprised that I haven't started to hate coding yet. I think it helps me professionally because now I am way more confident about making websites than I was just a week ago be it for any purpose. It does have a larger point beyond this class, beyond just a module, its personal, its empowering and it sets us apart from the mundane monotonous minimalist life. \n\n\n\n \n",

It also watered my hope of being able to do design in this era of AI, **The idea and belief that websites can be built considering that these are made for humans, not a robot that is there just to get information,  Just like how talking to a person isn't only about getting facts, but also about experiencing their personality, websites can be the same. They can feel alive, expressive, and full of character.**\n\nThe idea of comparing websites to a person who is communicating with us, was introduced to me by a book by everett N. McKayI some years ago and i always used to think that websites can also be more visually appealing, have more personality, and be expressive. And today, I got introduced to this small web era, and I could not stop browsing more and more websites. Neocities really blew my mind, some of the websites there were very creative and mind-blowing. And using the Wayback Machine was also very fun it kind of felt like using a time machine.\n\nClass Assignment:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/k1o1fyoyAyg34pRNz9xt2k/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=MYHLaNW6VNkvUMlK-1\n\n\n<img width=\"633\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/335c4a5f-8668-4125-87c8-9be80d495a05\" />\n",

I want it to be like I am as a person professional at first encounter, but when you dig deeper in breadcrumbs/interact more with it and go inside and inside it, you will get to know my interests and how I am as a person, what my work ethics are, and basically my personal space.\n\nI want it to be very graphic, visually appealing, artistic, playful kind of mood professional but in a creative way, something that is not dictated by rules/guidelines, free, entho-driven, and again very much **GRAPHIC**.\nIts visual identity should communicate my entho and work ethics about aesthetics and how much I value art in my work.\n\nTo me, this space would mean or I want it to mean a place where I can truly express my interests, my opinions, my philosophy (not in a literal way, but in the way it's designed), and something that is truly **MY OWN.**\n\nThis space will grow as I grow professionally, and as my interests grow, as my knowledge grows. I will keep adding projects/works that I will be doing articles, writings, posters (which I do as a hobby) and I want it to grow like a tree, not a building. I mean something that can grow in different directions and develop into different sub-branches.\n\n",

I think I am being very choosy about it. First, I was thinking of something very flashy and ornamental, but then I wasn't confident about that and thought it might irritate the visitor. Then I considered something simpler or something that isn’t very graphic, but again, that didn’t feel right. So I’m feeling stuck. I’ll try again tomorrow for layout ideas that don’t overwhelm the visitor but are still visually appealing and unique at some level. Below are some explorations from today’s ideas.\n\n\n<img width=\"943\" height=\"587\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbad1d5e-0f7c-4859-b8ae-22993f535b95\" />\n<img width=\"446\" height=\"722\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a3ac13-d23f-4b7c-9c8e-0026f522bbea\" />\n<img width=\"760\" height=\"612\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fa3912-3ea1-4842-88d1-56b552650101\" />\n\n\nApart from that, reading those articles about hierarchies was fun and informative.",

The Internet is such a vast and endless space; there's so much cool stuff out there of which we have no idea. \n- the push to search and explore archived websites, new-age websites, websites that look simple but are much cooler to the tech-savvy websites wouldn't have happened otherwise if not for the assignment\n- People have been creating uniquely crafted websites even before there was a need or competitive urge to do so. Why? How? probably out of sheer care for what they do.\n-while web surfing, whenever I came across an interesting interaction or feature or a gesture, it intrigued me how it would have happened, what it is called, and how I can do it. But usually this burst of enthusiasm or sudden urge to transform myself 180 degrees is ephemeral and dies soon. So I need to figure out a way to keep the curiosity ignited throughout the module to make the best of it!\n- The reading \" My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be?\"  explains the world of the internet to a technologically challenged person like me about the web and the internet in a very \"easy-to-understand\" manner.

This type of individual project-based learning, which is also collaborative in a sense, has felt so much more productive. TBH, before the module began, my assumptions were that my inhibitions for making a website would grow stronger, just with the sound of HTML and CSS in the class description.

          "content": "# Day 6 - Making grids\n**What worked**\n-Firstly, the constant reassurance that it may seem hard now, but we will be able to figure out and get the hang of it \n-the practice of \"coding along\" whenever we learn something new\n-the game which helped bring clarity to the logic of the codes\n-the assignment through i am trying to stay a(float) :P ( the pun was intented)\n\n**What didn't work/ or seems not to work for now**\n-ig its in my head, maybe, but \"coding along\" sessions as much as they are necessary, sometimes they also feel like a life jacket. What I mean by life jacket is, as soon as we are asked to do something of our own or to do something like today's exercise,  I feel like that life jacket has been taken away, and now how am I going to get through this? Not that I am stressing about it, but before beginning any HTML file, initially, it feels overwhelming.\n-the initial youtube video that we had seen which had explained the idea of body, parapgraph and other tags had helped me visualise, it would be great if there were more tangible examples to explain section, div, main and article which we have learned recently, because i like to imagine these entities and assoicate them with real life objects to understand them better.\n-also, \"github\" \"server\" seems like words that are difficult to imagine what it would look like. For eg, the interface or the idea of Facebook and Instagram does not seem really difficult to understand because maybe I am able to relate them to real-life scenarios. When I had downloaded Discord, I was feeling so frazzled with the idea of servers, rooms, and channels. I still find it difficult to navigate, but slowly i dont feel taken aback with the interface. So similarly, for me github's interface seems slightly overwhelming.\n\n**Grid**\nPersonally, from Jen Simmon's video, I loved how she thought we could take inspiration from the De Stijl art movement into a grid. I am looking forward to trying unconventional layouts in grids, which, for once are designed for me and not an imaginary user. ",

Tbh, I never knew websites like the ones I saw on Geocities or WebArchives could exist. For me, the definition of web design up until I saw these cool sites was the \"conventional website,\" which we commonly see. \n- The metaphor of a garden, to explain that websites can be there to track your growth, progress, and overall life documentation, has been helpful to explore today\n\n# Manifesto\n\nAs an introvert, I think I rely on art and other faceless mediums to express myself, and I think a website could be one of them. I want spaces to have multiple little windows into my life, revealing just enough to be curious. Till now, I have explored multiple mediums of art, different areas of design, and struggles of switching career fields ( from architecture to visual design), had my \"owning my curly hair \" journey, struggled with food allergies in a country like India, where the idea of food allergies is very alien, and found my ways to naviagte through a world overcrowded with extroverts. Thus, with this website, I would want to talk about topics I wish I had known before, along with the work that I have done revolving around the subjects of my interest. \n\n As I am writing this manifesto at this very moment, I can visualise different layouts and ideas: a quiet corner, a rant space,  space for an introvert, my allergy treatment journey, and a whole lot of paw prints ( just like digital footprints) for the good bois-doggos we don't appreciate enough\n\n# bonus question \n\nI feel it is somewhat beneficial to have your platform to express yourself on the web, but I am not aware of how much it helps in acquiring work, such as jobs, commissions, or freelance projects. Perhaps I am still a novice in understanding the benefits, but if I invest my time and effort in creating something, I would naturally desire to reap the benefits and fruits of my labor. Because I may create a website now with a sudden urge of enthusiasm, but without any viewers, I doubt how motivated I will be later to maintain or update it. Although keeping aside the constraints of coding, the idea of creating a web space that is unconventional sounds cool as an approach; to be able to achieve something from the reference website would be a huge confidence booster. As far as the \"Is there a larger point beyond this class? Do you see this helping you professionally? \" question is concerned, I would say yes! Definitely, this class has opened new learning portals for me. Not sure atm how I'm going to incorporate it in my style or practice, but there's room for it definitely, because it has made me curious to learn/explore further\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/206d1a2f-07b1-4f94-bf61-27b0133f5585)",

I am still unsure about what I want to place and what to skip, which of the texts will be links or icons or buttons. And maybe I have been looking at them for too long, but now i am unable to think what can i do further or where exactly should i place the contents. i am keen on taking further the building facade idea and the garden idea. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41d1ec19-ba0a-49a2-8de0-161194501bd6)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684a83cb-8e10-4ded-b4e8-8f3fd9bff403)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b85b62a-d063-43ab-bdc9-376ae92fda31)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53644c2d-2bfe-4fe3-be54-0fd4c7764972)",

It’s imperfect, maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. - This made me feel less bad for my unfinished portfolio website.\n- Metaphors are powerful for understanding and explaining something.\n\nTo sum up today’s class, it definitely gave me a unique perspective towards websites and somewhere made me rethink my relationship with coding.\n\n \n\n[Class Assignment | Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/AuA4d8gcFeyKxwFK90mZrb/Web-Assignment-01?node-id=1-8&t=TVNyKHNyxdF3T74m-1)\n\n[WWW-MeetBaxi.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21352727/WWW-MeetBaxi.pdf)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/896d9d58-bd8c-44e2-b4ad-ed40298ade9b)\n\n\n\n",

I found it difficult,  or maybe I’m just lazy, to remember each one.\n- < p2 > Bad: Vague and inconsistent tag names < /p2 >\n- < !DOCTYPE html > – Please don’t forget to write this.\n\nAs tomorrow is a NO CODE DAY, I’m definitely looking forward to it. 🫠\n\n<img width=\"543\" height=\"667\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6bedbf8-94f0-44eb-9d15-37947a6579f6\" />\n\n",

Since i am a person who likes jumping and exploring a bunch I just.could.not.pick.one.damn.niche. And then I finally got it, i gotta zoom out. What are the general things i like and the GENERAL things that stay constant in my life - my first answer was the colour purple before i remembered that colours make me feel things pretty deeply and influence my thoughts and what if i stopped liking purple?? plus i would stay stuck choosing colours foreverrrrrrrrrrr. so back to the drawing board , how can it be made simpler- we keep it black and white for now and have three lists for my website-\n1. Gratitude list- whre i write something i am thankful for every day\n2.  learnings-  i am a person that has many many AHA moments, but i often forget them lol so here's where i note those down. A TIL list plus old learnings as i remember them ig.\n3. One thing i like about myself or something i did. \n\nWorking on my website making skills with w3school and looking at other people's websites plus inspecting , struggling to find nice websites that dont use javascript.\n",

          "content": "### **Immersive Web Design - Assignment 1**\n\n#### **1. Class Learning’s:**\n\nThe first question we were asked was what do we imagine a website looks like…\n**Website as a Tree**\nI’ve come to see a website much like a tree. The homepage acts as the trunk — the central structure, the face of it all. From there, links and buttons branch out like limbs and leaves, guiding visitors to different areas and experiences. Just as a tree needs daily care and nurturing to grow from a sapling into something strong and full of life, a website too requires consistent attention, updates, and creativity to thrive. This metaphor helps me connect with the process more personally and organically.\n\n**Class Notes – Day 1 Reflection**\nThe first class gave me a new sense of confidence — helping me view the web and websites not as intimidating networks of code, but as creative, personal spaces. Coming from a commerce background and now venturing into design, the idea of working with code felt daunting at first. But the way the class unfolded made it approachable, step by step, one day at a time.\n\nWhat surprised me most was discovering that the internet can be a platform for self-expression. Until now, I always saw websites as formal, impersonal entities. That perspective shifted entirely. Now, I see them as living canvases — spaces that can reflect individuality, creativity, and personal voice.\n\nThis was truly a “learning by unlearning” experience — letting go of preconceived notions and opening up to new ways of seeing and creating. It was exciting, and I’m looking forward to what comes next.\n\n#### **2.

Today felt satisfying because I was actually able to grasp the language. I also explored new websites that could support my learning and make understanding code easier. However, I do feel that I still have a long way to go before I become fully comfortable with this aspect of design.",

I always appreciate learning through doing. Reading helps a lot but when we actually sit to do things ourselves it gives an opportunity to try new things, these trials might fail but every trail is a lesson in itself. The part of the class where we styled a web page along with the professor gave a different kind of excitement towards coding and actually seeing results on the screen. Looking forward to more such activities. \n\nBasic Design Layout:\nThe following is a basic step by step process i have done to get a layout for the story web page:\n1. The first rough idea-\n \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68690828-beb1-438a-84f6-cb001fe87c63)\n\n2.

Everywhere you look, websites feel like copies of each other—same grids, same layouts, same interactions. But it wasn’t always like this. Today we saw some old websites—the ones that were weird, wild, and wonderfully unpredictable. They weren’t perfect, but they were bold.\n\n<img width=\"802\" height=\"913\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c508b0a5-c992-4b2e-8cff-f4ef24d06fdb\" />",

Along the way, I discovered a few new websites that helped me explore different styles and structures. What really stood out, though, was the concept of learning through games—it turned abstract tags and attributes into fun, memorable experiences, making everything click so much faster.\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/v3pQTpg9EiEMUKgUcPC3nq/Untitled?node-id=20-24&t=zi0d87F52xMtWtob-1\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fbbfc9a-8c69-4818-ad47-e89da55a9663)",

At first, it was a bit confusing to figure out where to start and how to structure the content. However, once I took the first step and began writing some basic code, things slowly started to make sense. As I continued experimenting and building, I figured out what to do next and gradually gained more confidence. By the end of the session, I was able to make meaningful progress and felt that I had done something productive.\n\n<img width=\"1887\" height=\"787\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf64ffe7-c4be-4b88-8fe4-e5be19b30190\" />\n\n",

Honestly, learning this way made layout design feel way less scary and way more exciting!**\n\n**Today’s chat about Jen Simmons and who we’re designing for really got me thinking it felt meaningful, not just about the visuals.\nCSS Grid was way more fun than I expected. It’s not just boxes it’s creative! I loved how it connects to our typography stuff too.\nBuilding things slowly from scratch made it feel doable.**",

Same with historical places. I’ve always been curious about stories from the past, and putting them here feels like a way to collect the ones that moved me.\nThen there's music and dramas they’ve honestly been my comfort space. Songs I replay when I’m low, shows that felt like friends. I want to share them like little pieces of what shaped me. And of course, an “About Me” page, just to say hey, this is who I am no big explanation, just vibes.\nI noticed some blogs are super minimal and chill, and I liked that. Not everything needs to be loud. I might borrow that soft, personal vibe.\nIn the end, maybe this doesn’t matter to the world, but it matters to me. It's a space that’s mine, and that feels like a good enough reason.\n\n**",

After planning and imagining it for so long, seeing it slowly come to life on the screen is such a cool feeling. I'm figuring things out as I go—experimenting with layouts, colors, fonts, and little hover effects that make it feel more me. There are definitely moments where I get stuck or frustrated, but I’m learning a lot in the process. It’s like building a digital version of myself, one line of code at a time.\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/907e6450-fb9d-4cb9-9682-b4bf65b2b6cf\" />\n\n**",

It was positive day where I learned about the tearm Indie Web, something that feels like ours. Got to know its principles. Went through many blogs and different websites that can help buiding my websites.\n\n<img width=\"1034\" height=\"886\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e430404-21ec-49f3-ae3a-4d959e3e824f\" />\n\n### My Manifesto\n\nThis website is about deep diving into my experiences where you will look at all of my work connected with my interests. Even building this website from scratch will itself be a part of my portfolio. This website is totally made by me without depending on any constraints where I have to follow somebody else’s guideline or layout. I believe in Independent Ownership where I as a designer can showcase my progress and share personal knowledge. It is a safe platform where you will flow freely. If you’ll give time in the exploration, it may assist you with many resources and insights.\nI will be updating my website in every 6 months and I always try to make it feel like a friend sharing his experiences to another friend.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fe1bb6-414c-4402-b623-f9e3ca0bf3fc)\n",

It was fascinating to see those     \n  old websites—watching them was both fun and creatively inspiring.\n-We all signed up for GitHub in class. At first, I found it a bit boring, but once I started exploring, it turned out to be pretty \n  interesting.\n-I also learned new things like how to comment properly on GitHub and other useful features.\n-Right now, I’ve completed my assignment, and it was such a fun experience. It felt so creative going through different websites \n  and seeing the amazing things people have built online.\n-The most important thing I learned was observing the evolution of websites from 1996 to 2024. It’s truly unimaginable how\n  much web design and development have improved over time.\n\n## Class Assignment \nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAGt0UF84D0/THzs-obMyxcxJHJ32_hYxg/view?utm_content=DAGt0UF84D0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h021f6dcaca\n\n<img width=\"719\" height=\"757\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e919bdb9-9af6-4a46-a4a2-64d7c0f9b212\" />",

A website can be a lot of things while also being functional. It can be a representation of one's self, an idea of life, something personal yet relating to others and much more. One part of the lecture that stayed with me was that **a product is user-centric where as art is author-centric.**\n\nI also liked the idea of comparing a website to a shelf where we can arrange light weight books or trinkets as per our liking and rearrange it as many times we wish and when something gets outdated we can simply replace it with something fresh. \n\nAssignment: https://www.icloud.com/freeform/062ncDY_od-4xIHENWZS6UWTQ#web_archeology\n\n<img width=\"1566\" height=\"939\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b4888a-c43c-4a4b-87a6-225a092d8140\" />",

I get to arrange everything into neatly structured layers and VS code makes the process much more pleasing. It's so easy to just start with a simple html tag and see where it leads to. Today's class was exciting yet not tiring. The assignment allowed me to brush up on all the tags and elements and attributes I had long forgotten. ",

While talking to people personally I tend to leave out some details or some aspects of my life for some reason. With this web page I won’t have to, this page will be me being true to myself and to people who view it. They will see my hobbies and interests through the page’s content and my creative and cheerful character through the theme. The use of bright colours will be welcoming to all and attract positive energy. It will be my personal digital journal where I can put up my work, what I do in my free time or what helps me calm myself during tough times and helps me to relax. I would also like to include some of my favourite songs to play in the background while people view my content. \n\n==============================================================================================\n\nLearning web development as a computer science student and learning web development as a designer are two very different things. In the first case, the purpose was just to build a web page that works (interactive and responsive). But as designers we learn to add meaning to such lifeless web pages. Along with building it we also learn to add our own touch to the web page and make it go from product to art. I am very excited to see the outcome of this exercise and how it will affect my web development skills. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4f092e-cdca-4f2a-ade5-384a169c54c4)",
